		<img src="../Images/boxing4.jpg" id="img" /><p>Muhammad Ali  was born in January 17, 1942. (died June 3, 2016) He was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist. Nicknamed "The Greatest",
	he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time.
	Ali was a leading heavyweight boxer of the 20th century, and he remains the only three-time lineal champion of that division. <br /><br />
His joint records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title and winning 14 unified title bouts stood for 35 years.
Ali is the only boxer to be named The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year six times. He has been ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, 
and as the greatest athlete of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated, 
the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC, and the third greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN Sports Century.
<br />
	<p>He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as the Thrilla in Manila, 
and his fight with George Foreman known as The Rumble in the Jungle which has been called "arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century"and was watched by a record estimated television
 audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time.
 Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish.
He was famous for trash-talking, and often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, anticipating elements of hip hop.</p></td>
