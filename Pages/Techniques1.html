<hr />
<p>The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as Jack Johnson.
</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Upright stance</li>
	<li>Semi-crouch</li>
	<li>Full crouch</li>
</ul>

<p>In a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the "textbook" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'

<hr /><h2 style="font-style:italic;"><a name="Punches">Punches.....</a></h2>
<hr />
There are four basic punches in boxing. 
<ul>
		<li>Jab</li>
		<li>Cross - in counter-punch with a looping</li>
		<li>Hook</li>
		<li>Uppercut</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Jab</b> – A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position.
 The jab extends from the side of the torso and typically does not pass in front of it. 
It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. 
</li><br />

<li><b>Cross</b> – A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line.
 The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. 
</li><br />

<li><b>Hook</b> – A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head.
From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). 
The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.
</li><br />

<li><b>Uppercut</b> – A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly.
 From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.
</li>
</ul>
