	<b>A painting of Minoan youths boxing, from an Akrotiri fresco circa 1650 BC. This is the earliest documented use of boxing gloves.</b></p>
	</td>
	<td><span>The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BC
Later depictions from the 2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamian nations of Assyria and Babylonia, and in Hittite art from Asia Minor.[citation needed]
 A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 BC) shows both boxers and spectators
These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the wrist.
The earliest evidence of fist fighting with the use of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete (c. 1500â€“1400 BC).
Various types of boxing existed in ancient India.
The earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as the Ramayana and Rig Veda. 
The Mahabharata describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.
Duels (niyuddham) were often fought to the death.[citation needed] During the period of the Western Satraps, the ruler Rudradaman - in addition to being well-versed in "the great sciences" which included Indian classical music, 
Sanskrit grammar, and logic - was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer. The Gurbilas Shemi, an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha.

<div class="para1">In Ancient Greece boxing was a well developed sport and enjoyed consistent popularity. <div id="para2">In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd Olympiad, 688 BC.</div>
The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue.
 Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard,
 in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common. 
Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists. 
Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon.</div> <br />
The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus. Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres. 
The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, 
and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was 
abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.</span>
