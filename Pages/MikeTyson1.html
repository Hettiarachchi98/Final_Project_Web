	<td><p>Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2005. 
He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title,
 at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old. 
Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. He won the WBC title in 1986 after stopping
 Trevor Berbick in the second round, and added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating 
James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987. This made Tyson the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and
 IBF titles, and the only heavyweight to successively unify them.<br /><br />
In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title again at the age of 35, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis. 
Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2006, after being knocked out in consecutive matches against journeymen Danny Williams and Kevin McBride. 
Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003, despite having received over $30 million for several of his fights and $300 million during his career. At the time the media reported that he had approximately $23 million of debt.
Tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring. Nicknamed "Iron" and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career,
 and later known as "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Tyson is considered one of the best heavyweights of all time. Tyson holds the third longest unified championship reign in heavyweight history at eight consecutive defenses. 
He currently ranks No. 14 in BoxRec's ranking of the greatest heavyweight boxers in history.  
He was ranked No. 16 on The Ring's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, and No.1 in the ESPN.com list of "The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History".</p></td>
